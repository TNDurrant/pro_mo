# protein_motif_finder
A python script for searching reference proteomes for proteins containing a specific sequence motif of interest entered by the user. Requires Biopython and a reference proteome file in the same directory contaning the protein sequences to search your motif against.  The file in this repository named 'uniprot_sprot_human_fasta.fasta' contains a recent Swissprot human reference proteome that can be used as the latter, or the user can utilise a reference proteome of their own if they require a difference source or species.  The programme will generate a new output file called 'motif_hits.txt' contaning the protein entries in the reference proteome that contain the user's sequence motif of interest.
